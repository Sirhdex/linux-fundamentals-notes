## Reflection
 - One challenge I encountered while studying Linux Fundamentals came during the section on Filtering Contents. The questions initially felt very irrelevant after going over the material, and I struggled to even understand what I was even asked to do for most of the questions. Instead of making progress, I found myself in old habits of trying to force a solution without having a full understanding of the topic. After stepping back, I realized that I needed a change of mind. I needed to acknowledge a knowledge gap and gather more information; humility is important. Recognizing when you don’t understand something is what allows for real growth to happen. I shifted my focus to research, review, documentation, and expanding my understanding of the tools involved in my lab.

 A specific example was the question involving the curl command. At first, it seemed very unrelated and far more complex than the questions that I had gone over, even in previous labs. However after researching how curl works and what it is commonly used for, I realized it was directly connected to problems I had gone over before. Once I got the purpose and syntax, I was able to solve the problem using information from the lecture that I had initially thought had no relevance to the question. The experience taught me that effective problem solving is not about brute forcing, but understanding and filtering them through research, review, documentation, and expanding my understanding.
